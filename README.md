## About the game
### - Introduction
The most important question for college students every day is: "What should I eat today?"<br>
Not only is it difficult to decide what to eat, but sometimes it’s unavoidable to consider factors like price and time, which makes the schedule extremely tight!<br>

through a game that captures the excitement of grabbing food and racing against time during lunch.
